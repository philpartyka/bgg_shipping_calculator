# BoardGameGeek Shipping Calculator Website

I built this tool to help potential customers estimate how much shipping would be for an item from my inventory.  To achieve this I had to input the dimensions and weight of each item in my inventory.  I also track the inventory of the shipping boxes at my disposal.  The website calculates the optimal box for the product and uses the pirateship api to get the lowest price for the customer.
